## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Events are loaded from `event_data.json` (or scraped live if extended).
2. Each event shows title, location, date/time, and description.
3. Clicking **Get Tickets** prompts the user to enter their email and consent.
4. Upon submission, the email is stored and user is redirected to the original event page.

> *Tip:* You can enhance the scraper module to pull live data dynamically.
